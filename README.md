# FEND Capstone - Travel App

This project is a travel application designed to help users plan their trips efficiently. Users can enter a destination and departure date, and the app will provide weather forecasts and images of the destination to aid in travel planning.

## Project Overview

This is a Front-End Capstone project for Udacity, developed as part of the Front-End Web Development (FEND) Nanodegree program. The app uses several external APIs to fetch relevant data, including:

- **Geonames API:** Provides geographic data, including latitude and longitude for locations.
- **Weatherbit API:** Supplies weather forecasts for the entered destination.
- **Pixabay API:** Retrieves images related to the destination.

## APIs Used

- **Geonames:** Fetches geographic data (latitude and longitude) based on the user's input location.
- **Weatherbit:** Provides weather forecasts for the entered destination.
- **Pixabay:** Retrieves relevant images of the destination for visual reference.
